Hi, I'm Samukelisiwe Thwala, a health science and software development student with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly digital experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading and listening to music.

I'm continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skills. My goal is to combine my knowledge of health science with web development to create innovative solutions in the healthcare industry. I believe in the power of technology to improve lives and am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.

I have a decent foundation in HTML, and CSS, and I'm currently exploring other languages. I am particularly interested in full-stack development and I am eager to learn more about both the back-end and front-end technologies
